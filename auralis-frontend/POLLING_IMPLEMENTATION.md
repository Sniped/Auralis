# Polling Implementation for Transcript and Analysis Data

## Overview
Implemented automatic polling for transcript and analysis data instead of showing error messages. The system will continuously retry fetching data every 5 seconds until it becomes available.

## Changes Made

### 1. TranscriptPanel Component (`components/TranscriptPanel.tsx`)

**Before:**
- Fetched transcript once
- Showed error message if file not found
- Required manual refresh to retry

**After:**
- Polls for transcript every 5 seconds
- Shows loading spinner while waiting
- Automatically stops polling once data is loaded
- Cleanup on unmount to prevent memory leaks

**Key Features:**
```typescript
- Initial fetch on mount
- setInterval polling every 5 seconds
- isMounted flag to prevent state updates after unmount
- Automatic cleanup with clearInterval
- No error states - just continuous loading
```

### 2. VideoPlayerModal Component (`components/VideoPlayerModal.tsx`)

**Updated Two Data Fetching Hooks:**

#### Transcript Data Polling
- Polls `/api/recordings/transcript` every 5 seconds
- Stops polling when data is successfully loaded
- Continues polling if file doesn't exist (404)
- No error states shown to user

#### Analysis Data Polling  
- Polls `/api/recordings/analysis` every 5 seconds
- Stops polling when data is successfully loaded
- Continues polling if file doesn't exist (404)
- No error states shown to user

### 3. AnalysisSection Component (`components/AnalysisSection.tsx`)

**Before:**
- Showed "Analysis not available" message
- Showed "Failed to load analysis" error message

**After:**
- Shows loading spinner with message: "Loading transcript data..."
- Subtitle: "This may take a few moments"
- No error states - relies on VideoPlayerModal polling

## User Experience

### Old Behavior
1. User uploads video
2. Opens video immediately
3. Sees "Transcript not available" error
4. Must close and reopen video to try again
5. Frustrating experience

### New Behavior
1. User uploads video
2. Opens video immediately
3. Sees loading spinner
4. Transcript appears automatically when ready (within 5 seconds)
5. Analysis appears automatically when ready (within 5 seconds)
6. Smooth, automatic experience

## Technical Details

### Polling Interval
- **5 seconds** between attempts
- Balances responsiveness with server load
- Can be adjusted by changing the interval value

### Cleanup Pattern
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  let pollInterval: NodeJS.Timeout | null = null;
  let isMounted = true;

  const fetchData = async () => {
    if (!isMounted) return;
    // ... fetch logic
    
    if (isMounted && hasData) {
      // Stop polling
      if (pollInterval) {
        clearInterval(pollInterval);
        pollInterval = null;
      }
    }
  };

  // Start polling
  pollInterval = setInterval(fetchData, 5000);

  // Cleanup
  return () => {
    isMounted = false;
    if (pollInterval) clearInterval(pollInterval);
  };
}, [dependencies]);
```

### Memory Leak Prevention
- `isMounted` flag prevents state updates after unmount
- `clearInterval` in cleanup function
- Polling stops when data is loaded
- Component unmount triggers cleanup

## Performance Considerations

### Network Requests
- Maximum 1 request per 5 seconds per data type
- 2 concurrent polls (transcript + analysis)
- ~24 requests per minute total (if data never arrives)

### Stopping Conditions
Polling stops when:
1. Data is successfully loaded
2. Component unmounts (video closed)
3. `videoKey` changes (different video opened)

### Error Handling
- Network errors are logged to console
- No error UI shown to user
- Polling continues despite errors
- Assumption: files will eventually be available

## Use Cases

### Immediate Video Playback
**Scenario:** User uploads video and immediately clicks to view it

**Before:** 
- Video plays
- Transcript shows error
- Analysis shows error
- Must close and reopen

**After:**
- Video plays
- Transcript shows loading spinner
- Analysis shows loading spinner
- Both populate automatically when ready

### Processing Delay
**Scenario:** AWS Transcribe takes 30 seconds to process

**Before:**
- User sees error for 30 seconds
- Must manually refresh

**After:**
- User sees loading spinner
- After 30 seconds, content appears automatically
- No user action required

### Long Processing Times
**Scenario:** Large file takes 5 minutes to process

**Result:**
- Continuous loading spinner
- ~60 polling attempts
- Content appears when ready
- No timeout (polls indefinitely)

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Exponential Backoff**: Increase interval over time (5s → 10s → 30s)
2. **Status API**: Check job status instead of polling file existence
3. **WebSocket**: Real-time updates when processing completes
4. **Progress Indicator**: Show estimated time remaining
5. **Manual Refresh Button**: Allow user to force immediate retry
6. **Timeout**: Stop polling after X minutes and show helpful message

### WebSocket Integration (Recommended)
```typescript
// Future implementation
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.auralis.com/jobs');
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const { jobId, status, outputUrl } = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (status === 'COMPLETED') {
    fetchTranscript(outputUrl);
  }
};
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Upload video and immediately open it
- [x] Verify loading spinner appears for transcript
- [x] Verify loading spinner appears for analysis
- [x] Wait for transcript to process (observe auto-population)
- [x] Wait for analysis to process (observe auto-population)
- [x] Close video while loading (verify no errors)
- [x] Open different video while loading (verify cleanup)
- [x] Check browser console for polling logs
- [x] Verify polling stops after data loads
- [ ] Test with 404 errors (file never exists)
- [ ] Test with network errors
- [ ] Verify no memory leaks after multiple open/close cycles

## Console Logging

### Expected Logs
```
Transcript not ready yet, will retry in 5 seconds...
Analysis not ready yet, will retry in 5 seconds...
(every 5 seconds until data is available)
```

### Success Logs
```
(Polling stops, no more logs)
```

### Error Logs (Non-Fatal)
```
Error fetching transcript: [error details]
(Polling continues)
```

## Summary

The polling implementation provides a seamless user experience by:
- Eliminating error messages for expected delays
- Automatically loading data when ready
- Requiring zero user intervention
- Maintaining clean component lifecycle management

Users can now upload and view videos immediately, with transcript and analysis data appearing automatically as soon as AWS processing completes.
